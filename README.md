Shifting Bloom Filter PostgreSQL Extension
------------------------------------------
This project is an implementation for the Shifting Bloom Filter Framework.

The Shifting Bloom Filter Framework is a framework for handling set 
queries using probabilistic data structures. The Shifting Bloom Filter Framework
is not an original idea by me. This project is simply an implementation for this
framework within the PostgreSQL database management system. The original work can
be found here:<br><br>
